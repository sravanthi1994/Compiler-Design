# Compiler Design
It is a recursive descent parser for LL(1) grammer. 
So far done:
1. Implemented scanner that reads tokens and does lexical analysis
2. Implemented Parser that constructs parse tree and does semantic checking
3. Constructed abstract syntax tree using Leblank-Cook table(Symabol table.java)
4. Type Checking is done along the AST
